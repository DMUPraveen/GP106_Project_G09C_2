class Morse_Decoder:
    '''
    Morse_Decoder class is used to decode the morse code recieved via the input signal
    The class operates as a state machine.
    Method get_signal(signal_state:bool,current_time)

    When this is executed depending on previous states that is stored in the class it will determine what the morse signal is doing.
    When decoder detects that the morse signal is over it will decode it and call the callback function provided upon construction with
    the decoded morse signal passed as an argument.

    Since morse code is time dependant (length of the pulses change its meaning) a timer is required for the operation of the class
    in order to calculate the duration of individual (low or high) signals. The timer can be provided in the contructor.

    Note:   there are no checks to see whether the current time is greater than all previously provided times or whether the elapsed time is correct
            providing time that is less than previouly provided times will have undocumented behaviout
            it is responisbility of the caller to ensure the provided time is correct (you can use time.time from the time library for example)
